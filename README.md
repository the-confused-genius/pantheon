## Problem statement
Train an ML Model to achieve 80% accuracy in detecting if a person is at risk of diabetes based on the dataset provided

## About the event
This is part of the event hosted by the rocketry club in new horizon college of engineering called light speed
which is a 24 hours coding event from 6/1/22 to 7/1/22.
The dataset was provided by the host of the event.
This track is the called the Health track 2

## About the code 
If the ipynb file is opened in the jupyter notebook or google colab notebook, the user can directly input the values and the ml model will predict if the patient has the risk of diabetes or not
